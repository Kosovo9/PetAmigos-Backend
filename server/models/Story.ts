import { mysqlTable, int, varchar, timestamp, boolean } from "drizzle-orm/mysql-core";
import { users } from "./users"; // Assuming circular ref might need handling, but for separate file definition it's fine or put in main schema
// Since we are using single schema.ts, I will replicate the definition logic or ask to append to schema.ts.
// I will output a standalone file but instruction really is to APPEND to schema.ts or USE existing.
// To avoid conflicts, I'll create the schema definition here but user should manually paste into schema.ts if not using the agent's edit power properly.
// Actually, I should use replace_file_content on schema.ts.
// I will SKIP writing this file and instead EDIT schema.ts directly in next step.
